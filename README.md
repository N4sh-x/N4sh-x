## About Me 🛠️

Hey, I'm @L0rr, a passionate pentester who loves diving into CTF challenges and breaking things just to fix them again. I spend my time sharpening my hacking skills, scripting in Python, and staying caffeinated.

## What I Do 💼

I’m all about:

- **CTF Challenges**: Always on the lookout for the next box to pwn.
- **Scripting**: Automating tasks to make life (and hacking) easier.
- **Learning**: Continuously leveling up my skills in cybersecurity and pentesting.

## Projects 🚀

Here are a few things I’ve been hacking on:

- **Pentesting Wiki:** Documenting everything I learn in my personal pentesting wiki.
- **CTF Write-ups**: Documenting my journey through various CTF challenges.
- **Custom Exploits**: Building and testing my own tools.
