## About Me 🛠️

Hey, I'm @L0rr, a passionate pentester who loves diving into CTF challenges and breaking things just to fix them again. I spend my time sharpening my hacking skills, scripting in Python, and staying caffeinated.

- 🔍 **Current Focus**: Mastering the art of exploit development and automation with Python.
- 💻 **Tools of the Trade**: Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, and a bunch of custom scripts.
- 🏆 **Favorite Pastime**: Competing in CTFs, where the real fun begins.

## What I Do 💼

I’m all about:

- **CTF Challenges**: Solving complex problems, reverse engineering binaries, and pwning boxes.
- **Scripting**: Automating tasks to make life (and hacking) easier.
- **Learning**: Continuously leveling up my skills in cybersecurity and pentesting.

## Projects 🚀

Here are a few things I’ve been hacking on:

- **CTF Write-ups**: Documenting my journey through various CTF challenges.
- **Custom Exploits**: Writing my own exploits for fun and learning.
- **Security Tools**: Building small tools to assist in penetration testing.
